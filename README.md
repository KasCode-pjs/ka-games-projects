# ka-games-projects
This is a repository to store all of my games/projects that I made on KA, mainly just to be able to load it onto an HTML page.

## Games to add
 - The Space Age
 - Jumpy Cube 3D

## Goal
This repository is made so that I can load heavy and laggy code from GitHub instead of using the inefficient editor on KA. It's also a good place to track updates and changes.
